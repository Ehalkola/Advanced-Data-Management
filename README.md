# Advanced-Data-Management
This is public repository for my journey to learn advanced data management. Mostly here will be exercises for my class at Lapland UAS, but there will be also some personal projects of my own related to the topic. Readme file will also be added when I have time to add it. Repository will be updated on at least weekly/monthly basis. Best Regards: EH

# Advanced-Data-Management
This is public repository for my journey to learn advanced data management. Mostly here will be exercises for my class at Lapland UAS, but there will be also some personal projects of my own related to the topic. Readme file will also be added when I have time to add it. Repository will be updated on at least weekly/monthly basis.

# Repository Structure & Info
Structure of this repository will be explained down below:
  There will be  at least 4-5 repositories, which might change in the future.
  These repositories will be: 
    1. Fun-Stuff, which contains my own personal projects etc. These can be for just fun, learning or just iterate what I have      learned during the course.
    2. Lectures, this folder has all the stuff done during the lectures, which mostly is just teachers examples, which I might      have formatted according to my own liking and style to enhance my learning.
    3. Tasks, basically contains all my exercises/tasks that I have done for this class.
    4. Testing, here I basically test mainly all my own and school projects/tasks.

While this is mainly for my studies, I liked the idea to create a repository that I can update all my personal learning experiences and journey related to it's topic. This way I have my own personal documentation, which can be seen of course everyone, while it could also possibly advance my own career or help someone elses.

I try to avoid using any type of AI through out this journey, maybe I might use it for some inspiration or how to format stuff correctly. Mainly I will do all coding by hand & use internet if I have problems.

Usual sources come from StackOverflow.

All documentation within this file can be used for educational purposes.

Just be aware that my coding style might not be the same as yours and you can adjust it to your own liking.

# Information About me
Some information about me:

## Coding & Data Management, Data Analytics, Job Experience
I personally have about 3 years worth of coding experience in Python and other C/C-based languages, so my code could need some improvements. I am also just learning Java so just be aware.  About data management & Analytics I have about 2 years of experience. Professionally I have not yet worked within fields of Data Analytics or Management, but I do hope that in some near future that might be possible. While I do have experience of working on some projects that included these topics, and I have worked in IT Assistant services, IoT Lab Trainee & as Production Engineer, from these I have about 5-6 months of practice.

As work experience from data bases I have experience on as an end user quite much, otherwise all experience has come through my studies or from my personal projects.
